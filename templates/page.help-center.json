Our warranty program covers the functionality of the hardware on each crafted piece — including rivets, straps, zippers, and closures — to ensure your bag continues to perform as intended. It does not cover normal wear and tear, cosmetic changes such as scratches or color transfer, or damage caused by outside factors. If your bag qualifies, we’ll repair it at no cost; if not, we’ll provide recommendations to keep you carrying Hammitt with confidence.</p>",
